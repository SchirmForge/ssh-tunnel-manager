# SSH Tunnel Manager - CLI Configuration
# This file should be placed at: ~/.config/ssh-tunnel-manager/cli.toml

# Connection mode determines how the CLI connects to the daemon
# Options: "unix-socket", "http", "https"
#
# - unix-socket: Connect via Unix domain socket (default, local-only)
# - http: Connect via HTTP (for testing, not secure)
# - https: Connect via HTTPS with TLS (for network access)
connection_mode = "unix-socket"

# Daemon address for HTTP/HTTPS modes (ignored in unix-socket mode)
# Examples:
#   "http://127.0.0.1:3443" - localhost HTTP
#   "https://192.168.1.100:3443" - remote daemon over HTTPS
daemon_url = "https://127.0.0.1:3443"

# Authentication token (required if daemon has require_auth = true)
# This token must match the daemon's token in daemon.token file
# Leave empty to disable authentication
auth_token = ""

# TLS certificate fingerprint for HTTPS mode (optional but recommended)
# This enables certificate pinning for secure connections
# The daemon will display this fingerprint on first run
# Format: SHA256 fingerprint as colon-separated hex (e.g., "AA:BB:CC:...")
tls_cert_fingerprint = ""

# ============================================================================
# Example configurations for different use cases:
# ============================================================================

# LOCAL USE ONLY (same machine as daemon):
# connection_mode = "unix-socket"
# No other configuration needed

# TESTING (localhost HTTP):
# connection_mode = "http"
# daemon_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3443"
# auth_token = "paste-token-here"

# NETWORK USE (remote daemon):
# connection_mode = "https"
# daemon_url = "https://192.168.1.100:3443"
# auth_token = "paste-token-here"
# tls_cert_fingerprint = "paste-fingerprint-here"
